## Bubble sort

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.

### Characteristics of bubble short:

- Simplest sorting.
- Starting from the first index, compare the first and the second elements.
- If the first element is greater than the second element, they are swapped.
- Not suitable for large data sets
- Worst time complexity O(nÂ²)
- Auxilarity space O(1)
- Bubble sort takes minimum time (Order of n) when elements are already sorted.
- The bubble sort algorithm is stable.
