## Merge sort

The Merge Sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that is based on the Divide and Conquer paradigm. In this algorithm, the array is initially divided into two equal halves and then they are combined in a sorted manner.

Here, a problem is divided into multiple sub-problems. Each sub-problem is solved individually. Finally, sub-problems are combined to form the final solution.

### Algorithm:

```
step 1: start

step 2: declare array and left, right, mid variable

step 3: perform merge function.
    if left > right
        return
    mid= (left+right)/2
    mergesort(array, left, mid)
    mergesort(array, mid+1, right)
    merge(array, left, mid, right)

step 4: Stop
```

<strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(N log(N)),  Sorting arrays on different machines. Merge Sort is a recursive algorithm and time complexity can be expressed as following recurrence relation. 

```
T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Î¸(n)
```

<strong>Auxiliary Space:</strong> O(n), In merge sort all elements are copied into an auxiliary array. So N auxiliary space is required for merge sort.
